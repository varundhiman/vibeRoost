# Frontend-Backend Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for connecting the React frontend to the Supabase Edge Functions backend. Currently, the frontend has placeholder implementations that need to be replaced with actual API calls to the deployed Edge Functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Review Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete reviews so that I can share my experiences with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the create review form THEN the system SHALL call the reviews Edge Function to create a new review
2. WHEN a user views the reviews page THEN the system SHALL fetch reviews from the reviews Edge Function
3. WHEN a user updates a review THEN the system SHALL call the reviews Edge Function with updated data
4. WHEN a user deletes a review THEN the system SHALL call the reviews Edge Function to remove the review
5. WHEN review operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2: Community Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and join communities so that I can connect with like-minded people.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a community THEN the system SHALL call the communities Edge Function to create a new community
2. WHEN a user views communities THEN the system SHALL fetch community data from the communities Edge Function
3. WHEN a user joins a community THEN the system SHALL call the communities Edge Function to add membership
4. WHEN a user leaves a community THEN the system SHALL call the communities Edge Function to remove membership
5. WHEN community operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 3: User Profile Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile so that other users can learn about me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL call the users Edge Function to save changes
2. WHEN a user views a profile THEN the system SHALL fetch user data from the users Edge Function
3. WHEN profile operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 4: Feed Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a personalized feed so that I can discover relevant content from my communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch feed data from the feed Edge Function
2. WHEN feed data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content
3. WHEN feed operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations are in progress or fail so that I understand the system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
2. WHEN any API operation fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect users to login

### Requirement 6: Data Validation and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe API calls so that runtime errors are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces for request/response data
2. WHEN receiving API responses THEN the system SHALL validate data structure before using it
3. WHEN API responses don't match expected types THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with error messages
