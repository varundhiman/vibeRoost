# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a mobile social recommendation app that allows users to review and recommend various items (movies, TV shows, restaurants, services, vacation spots, recipes, and activities) within community-based networks. The app differentiates itself from traditional review platforms by emphasizing social connections and community trust, where recommendations from known users carry more weight. The system integrates with external APIs (Google for places/services, Rotten Tomatoes for entertainment) to reduce redundancy and provide comprehensive information.
