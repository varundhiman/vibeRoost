# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration from Java Spring Boot microservices to Supabase Edge Functions for the VibeRoost social recommendation application. The goal is to replace the complex local backend infrastructure with serverless functions that integrate seamlessly with the existing Supabase database and authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management Edge Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the Java user-service with Supabase Edge Functions, so that user operations are handled serverlessly and integrate directly with Supabase Auth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user profile needs to be created or updated THEN the system SHALL provide Edge Functions for user CRUD operations
2. WHEN user blocking functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL implement block/unblock Edge Functions
3. WHEN user authentication is required THEN the system SHALL leverage Supabase Auth integration in Edge Functions
4. WHEN user data validation is needed THEN the system SHALL implement proper validation in TypeScript Edge Functions

### Requirement 2: Community Management Edge Functions

**User Story:** As a user, I want community features to work through serverless functions, so that I can create, join, and manage communities without backend service dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new community THEN the system SHALL provide an Edge Function for community creation
2. WHEN joining or leaving a community THEN the system SHALL handle membership operations via Edge Functions
3. WHEN listing communities THEN the system SHALL provide efficient community discovery Edge Functions
4. WHEN managing community settings THEN the system SHALL support community administration through Edge Functions

### Requirement 3: Review System Edge Functions

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage reviews through serverless functions, so that the review system is scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a review THEN the system SHALL validate and store reviews via Edge Functions
2. WHEN retrieving reviews THEN the system SHALL provide efficient review fetching Edge Functions
3. WHEN updating or deleting reviews THEN the system SHALL handle review modifications through Edge Functions
4. WHEN rating items THEN the system SHALL calculate and store ratings via Edge Functions

### Requirement 4: Feed Generation Edge Functions

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personalized feed to be generated efficiently, so that I see relevant content from my communities and followed users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a user feed THEN the system SHALL create personalized content feeds via Edge Functions
2. WHEN new content is posted THEN the system SHALL update relevant feeds through Edge Functions
3. WHEN feed sorting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement configurable sorting algorithms
4. WHEN real-time updates are required THEN the system SHALL integrate with Supabase Realtime

### Requirement 5: External API Integration Edge Functions

**User Story:** As a user, I want external data (movies, restaurants, etc.) to be fetched efficiently, so that I can review items from external sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for movies THEN the system SHALL integrate with external movie APIs via Edge Functions
2. WHEN looking up restaurants THEN the system SHALL fetch restaurant data through Edge Functions
3. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting in Edge Functions
4. WHEN caching external data THEN the system SHALL cache responses to improve performance

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Migrations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be properly set up in Supabase, so that Edge Functions can interact with structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL create all necessary tables in Supabase
2. WHEN defining relationships THEN the system SHALL implement proper foreign key constraints
3. WHEN securing data THEN the system SHALL implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts for existing data

### Requirement 7: API Gateway Replacement

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a unified API interface, so that the frontend can interact with Edge Functions through consistent endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL provide consistent REST-like endpoints via Edge Functions
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens in Edge Functions
3. WHEN handling CORS THEN the system SHALL properly configure CORS for web app access
4. WHEN error handling is needed THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses

### Requirement 8: Development and Deployment Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an efficient development workflow, so that I can develop, test, and deploy Edge Functions easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide local development setup with Supabase CLI
2. WHEN testing functions THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for Edge Functions
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL automate deployment to Supabase
4. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide logging and error tracking for Edge Functions

### Requirement 9: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the existing React app to work seamlessly with Edge Functions, so that users experience no disruption during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating API calls THEN the system SHALL modify the frontend-shared library to use Edge Function endpoints
2. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Supabase Auth integration
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL update Redux slices to work with new API endpoints
4. WHEN error handling THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent error handling patterns

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Edge Functions to be performant and scalable, so that the application can handle growing user loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL auto-scale Edge Functions based on demand
2. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement efficient database queries
3. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and alerting
