# Frontend Shared Library Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup performed on the frontend-shared library after the Edge Functions migration.

## Removed Code

### 1. API Client (`src/api/client.ts`)
- **Removed offline storage functionality**: Eliminated `OfflineStorageService` import and usage
- **Simplified GET method**: Removed offline caching and fallback logic
- **Removed unused constructor parameter**: Cleaned up offline storage initialization

### 2. API Configuration (`src/api/config.ts`)
- **Removed offline support config**: Eliminated `enableOfflineSupport` from `ApiConfig`
- **Updated external API endpoints**: Fixed paths to match actual Edge Function structure (`/external-apis/` instead of `/external/`)

### 3. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- **Removed legacy User interface**: Eliminated backward compatibility interface that was no longer used
- **Removed PrivacySettings interface**: No longer needed after removing legacy User interface
- **Removed unused Post and Comment interfaces**: Simplified to only keep FeedItem for feed functionality

### 4. Service Classes

#### UserService (`src/services/userService.ts`)
- **Removed legacy methods**: Eliminated `getUserProfile()`, `updateUserProfile()`, and `updatePrivacySettings()`
- **Removed file upload method**: Eliminated `uploadProfilePicture()` placeholder
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused `User` and `PrivacySettings` imports

#### FeedService (`src/services/feedService.ts`)
- **Removed deprecated post management methods**: Eliminated all post/comment CRUD operations with console warnings
- **Removed legacy compatibility methods**: Eliminated `getPosts()`, `getPost()`, and `uploadPostPhotos()`
- **Simplified interfaces**: Removed unused `CreatePostRequest`, `UpdatePostRequest`, and `CreateCommentRequest`
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed unused `Post`, `Comment`, and `ContentType` imports

#### ExternalApiService (`src/services/externalApiService.ts`)
- **Removed legacy method aliases**: Eliminated `searchGooglePlaces()`, `getGooglePlaceDetails()`, `searchRottenTomatoes()`, and `getRottenTomatoesDetails()`
- **Streamlined to core functionality**: Kept only the new Edge Function-compatible methods

#### ReviewService (`src/services/reviewService.ts`)
- **Removed file upload method**: Eliminated `uploadReviewPhotos()` placeholder

## Benefits of Cleanup

### 1. Reduced Code Complexity
- Eliminated 200+ lines of unused/deprecated code
- Removed confusing legacy methods with console warnings
- Simplified service interfaces

### 2. Improved Maintainability
- Removed duplicate functionality (legacy vs new methods)
- Eliminated dead code paths
- Cleaner import statements

### 3. Better Performance
- Removed offline storage overhead
- Eliminated unnecessary transformations between legacy and new formats
- Simplified API client request flow

### 4. Clearer API Surface
- Services now expose only the methods that actually work with Edge Functions
- Removed placeholder methods that threw errors
- More consistent naming and structure

## Remaining Code Structure

The cleaned-up library now contains:

### Core Services
- **UserService**: Profile management, search, and blocking
- **CommunityService**: Community CRUD, membership, and discovery
- **ReviewService**: Review CRUD, likes, and reviewable items
- **FeedService**: Feed retrieval and refresh (simplified)
- **ExternalApiService**: Movie and restaurant search via Edge Functions

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **ApiClient**: Streamlined HTTP client with Edge Function support
- **SupabaseAuthService**: Authentication integration (unchanged)
- **Types**: Clean type definitions matching Edge Function schemas

## Next Steps

1. **Update tests** to reflect the cleaned-up API surface
2. **Update documentation** to remove references to removed methods
3. **Implement file upload** using Supabase Storage when needed
4. **Consider removing offline storage module** entirely if not used elsewhere

The frontend shared library is now significantly cleaner and focused on the Edge Functions architecture.
