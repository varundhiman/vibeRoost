# ðŸ”’ Netlify Security Configuration

## Secrets Scanning Configuration

Netlify's secrets scanning has been configured to allow the following environment variables in the build output:

### Safe to Expose (Public Frontend Variables):

- **`REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`** - Public Supabase project URL
- **`REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`** - Public anonymous key (designed for frontend use)
- **`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`** - Public API endpoint URL

### Why These Are Safe:

1. **Supabase Anon Key**: Despite the name containing "key", this is specifically designed to be public and used in frontend applications. It has limited permissions and is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

2. **Public URLs**: These are publicly accessible endpoints that need to be known by the frontend application.

3. **React Environment Variables**: Any `REACT_APP_*` variable is automatically included in the frontend bundle and is meant to be public.

### Configuration in netlify.toml:

```toml
[build.environment]
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = "REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL,REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL"
```

### What Remains Protected:

- **Service Role Key**: Never exposed in frontend code
- **JWT Secret**: Only used in backend Edge Functions
- **Database Password**: Only used in backend connections
- **Private API Keys**: Never included in frontend builds

## Security Best Practices Maintained:

âœ… No sensitive backend credentials in frontend code
âœ… Proper separation of public vs private environment variables
âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect database access
âœ… Service role keys kept secure in backend only

This configuration allows the build to complete while maintaining proper security practices.
